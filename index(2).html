<h4>I Lay My Love on You</h4>
<h3> By Westlife</h3>
I

Just a smile
And the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart

II

Just a smile
And there's no way back
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
But there's an angel
And she's calling me
Reaching for my heart

Refrain:

I know, that I'll be OK now
This time it's real
Chorus:
I lay my love on you
It's all I want to do
Every time I breathe
I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love,
And walk right through
As I lay my love on you

III:

I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly believe it (yeah)
Holding on to yesterdays
Far, far too long
Refrain:
Now I believe it's okay cause
This time it's real

Chorus:

I lay my love on you
It's all I want to do
Every time I breathe
I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love,
And walk right through
As I lay my love on you

Brige:

I never knew
That love could feel so good

[Instrumental]

Like a once in a lifetime
You change my world

Chorus:

I lay my love on you (you)
You make me feel brand new
Show me your love,
And walk right through (oh yeah)
As I lay my love on you

I lay my love on you
It's all I want to do
Every time I breathe
I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love,
And walk right through
As I lay my love
(I lay my love) on you

I lay my love on you
You make me feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love,
And walk right through
As I lay my love on you

As I lay my love on you.
